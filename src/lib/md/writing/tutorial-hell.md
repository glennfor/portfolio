# My personal experience with tutorial hell

Hello, everyone! I'm a computer engineering student who loves to learn new things and challenge myself. But sometimes, I bite off more than I can chew and end up in what some people call "tutorial hell". What is tutorial hell, you ask? Well, it's when you spend more time watching or reading tutorials than actually doing something with what you learned. It's when you feel like you need to learn everything before you can start a project. It's when you get overwhelmed by the amount of information and options available and lose motivation.

I've been there, and I'm sure many of you have too. In this blog post, I want to share my personal experience with tutorial hell and how I managed to get out of it. Hopefully, this will help some of you who are struggling with the same problem.

## How I got into tutorial hell

It all started when I decided to learn Rust and Assembly as well as how to do PCB design. Why did I choose these topics? Well, Rust is a modern and safe programming language that is gaining popularity and has many applications. Assembly is a low-level language that gives you direct control over the hardware and is useful for performance optimization and reverse engineering. PCB design is the process of creating printed circuit boards that connect electronic components and devices.

I thought these topics would be fun and useful for my future career as a computer engineer. And they are, don't get me wrong. But they are also very complex and require a lot of time and effort to master. And that's where I made a mistake. I tried to learn them all at once.

I subscribed to several online courses, bought some books, watched some YouTube videos, joined some Discord servers, followed some blogs, etc. I wanted to learn from different sources and perspectives, thinking that would give me a better understanding. But instead, it gave me confusion and frustration.

I realized that there was no single or best way to learn these topics. There were different opinions, approaches, tools, standards, etc. Some of them contradicted each other, some of them were outdated, some of them were too advanced or too basic for me. I didn't know who to trust or what to follow.

I also realized that there was too much to learn. Each topic had its own syntax, concepts, libraries, frameworks, etc. And each of them had their own dependencies, prerequisites, compatibility issues, etc. I felt like I had to learn everything before I could do anything.

I spent hours and hours watching or reading tutorials, taking notes, doing exercises, etc. But I never actually applied what I learned to a real project. I never created anything of my own. I never experimented or explored. I never had fun.

I was stuck in tutorial hell.

## How I got out of tutorial hell

So how did I escape from this situation? Well, it wasn't easy or quick. It took me several months and a lot of trial and error. But eventually, I found a way that worked for me. Here are the steps that I took:

1. **I prioritized one topic at a time**. Instead of trying to learn everything at once, I focused on one topic that interested me the most or that had the most immediate benefit for me. For me, that was Rust. I decided to put Assembly and PCB design on hold until I felt more comfortable with Rust.
2. **I set a specific goal for myself**. Instead of just learning for the sake of learning, I gave myself a concrete and achievable goal that would motivate me and guide me. For me, that was creating a simple command-line tool that would convert text files to PDFs using Rust.
3. **I chose one source of learning**. Instead of jumping from one tutorial to another, I stuck with one source that was reliable and suitable for my level and style of learning. For me, that was The Rust Programming Language book by the official Rust team.
4. **I applied what I learned as soon as possible**. Instead of just watching or reading tutorials, I tried to use what I learned in my own project as soon as possible. Even if it was just a small piece of code or a simple feature, I wrote it down and tested it out.
5. **I learned by doing**. Instead of just following tutorials step by step, I experimented with different options and solutions, made mistakes and learned from them, asked questions and searched for answers, etc. I learned by doing rather than by copying.
6. **I had fun**. Instead of feeling stressed or bored by tutorials, I enjoyed the process of learning and creating something new. I celebrated my progress and achievements, no matter how small or big they were.

By following these steps, I managed to get out of tutorial hell and finish my project in a few weeks. It wasn't perfect or professional, but it was mine and it worked. And I learned a lot along the way. I also gained confidence and curiosity to learn more and try new things.

## Conclusion

Tutorial hell is a common problem that many learners face, especially in the field of computer engineering. It can be caused by various factors, such as trying to learn too many things at once, not having a clear goal or direction, relying too much on tutorials, etc. It can result in wasting time and energy, losing motivation and interest, and not achieving anything.

The solution to tutorial hell is not to avoid tutorials altogether, but to use them wisely and effectively. Tutorials can be great resources for learning new skills and concepts, but they are not enough by themselves. They need to be complemented by practice, experimentation, exploration, etc.

The key to escaping tutorial hell is to find a balance between learning and doing, between theory and practice, between following and creating. And most importantly, to have fun along the way.

I hope this blog post was helpful and inspiring for you. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them below. And if you have your own experience with tutorial hell or tips on how to avoid it, please share them with me and the rest of the readers.

Thank you for reading and happy learning!
